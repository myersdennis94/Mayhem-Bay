## Description
Mayhem Bay is a single player endless runner game. From a top down perspective, a user takes control of a ship and attempts to survive an endless barrage of terrain and obstacles as long as possible. A score will be kept and tallied based upon an average velocity, time passed, and a base ship score modifier. With a total of five vessels for the player to choose from, a variety of gameplay experiences exist for the user to explore. Mayhem Bay was created in the Java programming language using the libraries [LibGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) and [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d).

### System Design
To complete the development of Mayhem Bay, an approach was taken to split the software elements involved into three components: entities, handlers, and states. Entities are the objects that need to be rendered or given physics bodies with box2d. Handlers are the objects that are responsible for setting up and managing entities and distributing any entity data between states. And, States are representations of different areas of the game that could be divided into different screens or interfaces. 

To manage these different components, exists the MayhemGame class. This class is the main class of the software system and is only called by the DesktopLauncher to launch the application. MayhemGame holds the only instances of the handlers and the assets needed throughout the system. One handler, GameStateManager, belongs to MayhemGame and is responsible for coordinating the transition between game states. During the execution of GameStateManager, multiple instances of the Play, Score, Menu, or Selection states are instantiated as needed. This can happen multiple times throughout the softwares use. Each instance of a game state is disposed of when a transition to a new game state occurs, thus all game states have a finite existence. The States themselves control the use of entities to complete tasks such as display interfaces and update and render play. Another handler, GameDataManager, assists in coordination between states by allowing a method for different states to access data that originates from entities.  Upon exit from the Mayhem Bay game, GameDataManager saves all relevant player information from the last game session to be loaded on the applications next use.
